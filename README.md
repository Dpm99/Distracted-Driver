# Distracted-Driver
Implemented a Deep Learning approach using transfer learning for the Kaggle Distracted Driver competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/overview).

As a solution for the Distracted Driver competition I implemented a deep learning model using transfer learning. The model used a pretrained ResNet50 from tensorflow as a feature extractor.
